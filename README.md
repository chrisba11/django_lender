# Django Book Lender App

**Author**: Chris Ball
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
This app is a work in progress. Currently, it allows an admin to create and modify books to a library and assign their state as 'checked-in' or 'checked-out'.

## Getting Started
To use this app, you'll need to clone the repo down, create a new virtual environment with pipenv shell, run pipenv install to download the dependencies, and then do something like docker-compose up --build to get it running. I think you'll need to create a superuser, also. Check back for updated info.
